what sorta works -
treeToDb/dbToTree
query language / composition
parser
basic reconciler
mutations
idents
query params / set-query
send / remotes
subquery / routing !!
server side reads
fix mutations api/flow

working on -
optimistic updates
server side writes
force
common mutations for store - merge, updateIn, etc
~ recursive joins
normalizing incoming data
pull out mutations/calls from parser?
allow params in more spots
`send` should be a saga
long lists perf
pagination
ttl caching

dev helper when optimistic actions don't get resolved in x secs

precise rendering - only updating the components that change

focus query
server side rendering
tempids
tests

flow / typescript annotation
