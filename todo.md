what sorta works -
treeToDb/dbToTree
query language / composition
parser
basic reconciler
mutations
idents
query params / set-query

optimistic reads / updates
subquery / routing !!

force
~ recursive joins
normalizing incoming data
pull out mutations/calls from parser?
allow params in more spots
api endpoint

long lists perf
pagination
ttl caching

dev helper when optimistic actions don't get resolved in x secs

precise rendering - only updating the components that change
