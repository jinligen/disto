what sorta works -
treeToDb/dbToTree
query language / composition
parser
basic reconciler
mutations
idents
query params / set-query
send / remotes
subquery / routing !!
server side reads
fix mutations api/flow

working on -
~ optimistic updates
server side writes
force
common mutations for store - merge, updateIn, etc
~ recursive joins
normalizing incoming data
allow variables in more spots
long lists perf
pagination
ttl caching
optimistic commits (so you don't lose optimistic effects)

dev helper when optimistic actions don't get resolved in x secs

precise rendering - only updating the components that change

focus query
server side rendering
tempids
tests
compose applications?

flow / typescript annotation
nicer parser/error messages :|

throw error on setting query on component withour ref / non root
