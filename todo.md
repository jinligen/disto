what sorta works -
treeToDb/dbToTree
query language / composition
parser
basic reconciler
mutations
idents
query params / set-query
send / remotes
optimistic reads / updates
subquery / routing !!
server side reads

working on -

server side writes

force
~ recursive joins
normalizing incoming data
pull out mutations/calls from parser?
allow params in more spots

long lists perf
pagination
ttl caching

dev helper when optimistic actions don't get resolved in x secs

precise rendering - only updating the components that change
server side rendering
tempids
tests
